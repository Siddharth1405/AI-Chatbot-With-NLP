A Python NLP chatbot using NLTK for natural conversations with mood detection.

**COMPANY**: CODETECH IT SOLUTIONS

**Name**: Siddharth Patel

**INTERN ID**: CT04DL819

**Domain**: Python Programming

**BATCH Duration**: 4 Weeks

**Mentor**: Neela Santhosh Kumar

**PROJECT**: AI CHATBOT WITH NLP

## Overview
Nubye is an AI-powered chatbot that demonstrates fundamental Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques using Python's NLTK library. This project showcases how simple NLP concepts can be applied to create an interactive conversational agent capable of understanding and responding to natural language inputs.

## Key Features
- **Natural Language Understanding**: Processes user inputs using regex patterns and response templates
- **Contextual Responses**: Maintains basic conversation context (name recognition, mood detection)
- **Sentiment Awareness**: Recognizes and responds differently to positive/negative user moods
- **Conversational Flow**: Manages multi-turn dialogues with logical transitions
- **Reflection Handling**: Uses pronoun substitution for more natural responses

## Technical Implementation
- Built with Python 3.x and NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)
- Utilizes pattern-response pairs for conversation management
- Implements basic text normalization through reflection rules
- Demonstrates fundamental NLP chatbot architecture

## Requirements
- Python 3.6+
- NLTK library (`pip install nltk`)

## Installation & Usage
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/nubye-chatbot.git
   cd nubye-chatbot
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install nltk
   ```

3. Run the chatbot:
   ```bash
   python task3.py
   ```

## How It Works
The chatbot uses a rules-based approach with:
- Regular expressions to match user input patterns
- Predefined response templates
- Reflection rules for pronoun substitution
- Basic conversation state management
